# Structure
# Introduction
- __What is creativity?__
  - "the ability to produce work that is both novel and appropriate"
- __How does it fit into requirements elicitation?__
  - "Elicitation" - the word "capturing is avoided"
  - --> discovering, understanding and documenting requirements. In the recent years it is considered that they should be rather invented or envisioned instead of just gathered from them.

# Current state in research and practice
- __Traditional techniques__ do not cover gathering requirements in a creative way.
- Typically, __problem analysis__ and system specification is the focus.
- This is embodied into many of the current processes and frameworks such as __i*__ , __KAOS__ or __RUP__.
- In __innovation management__, there is usually a focus on short-term market trends. Most of them don't focus on a practical elicitation of ideas, but are rather abstract models or recommendation for the higher management.


# Why dös it mätter
- Requirements engineering itself is a __creative process__: In practice, many stakeholders express themselves creatively.
- The industry expects that creative design is expected to increase in the __future__.
- This is because the analytical, reactive view is considered narrow and might not provide enough __innovation in the long term__.
- The assumption that __invention is part of the design process__ is considered outdated.

# Why dös it mätter
- The assumption that the generation of requirements depends on the __knowledge of individuals__ is outdated.
- Innovation depends on the gathering of new ideas. __Requirements are an abstraction of these ideas__. This suggests that the creative process is a part of the requirements elicitation process.
- There is also a broad range of stakeholders that could be leveraged for the innovation process. The __restriction of design to the design phase__ limits innovation.

# Why dös it mätter
- To conclude: __Creative requirements engineering techniques and idea gathering are important for the innovation of a product, project or company. The biggest issues are lack of available methods, awareness and risk-aversity. We will now introduce two techniques that aim at eliciting new, innovative requirements.__

# We introduce two processes:

# RESCUE
## Background
- Inspired by scientific approaches from __creativity theory__
- __Concurrent engineering process with different modelling and analysis techniques.__
- Focus on __system goal and use-case modelling.__


# RESCUE
## Principles
- __Based on creativity workshops to support three different models from creativity theory__
1. Designed to support __divergence and convergence__ on ideas
2. Each workshop encourages three different __types of creativity: exploratory, combinatorial ans transformational__
3. Support four different __creative processes: Preparation, Incubation, Illumination and Verification.__

# RESCUE
## Experience
- The model was tested using __six iterations__ of workshop series.
- The first one was considered successfull and created __200 ideas__ and requirements.
- The second and subsequent workshops were all successfull. This led to __refinements__ in the structure, which were then tested in a workshop with MSP (??).
- Existing __use-cases__ provided the __basis__ for the workshop.
- Different activites took place over the days of the workshop.
  - __Brain storming, Constraint identification and removal__
  - __Analogical mappings__ to other domains were achieved by listening to experts from other domains.
  - Expert presentation on __visualization__

# RESCUE
## Experience
### Findings:
- __First iteration__:
  - __200 ideas were invented by 20 people__. __50__ of them were found to be __useful__.
  - Important __learnings and improvements__ were made to the structure, such as running the workshops early in the project.
  - The __existing creativity theories__ are not sufficient for requirements elicitation. Dedicated techniques might need to be invented.

# RESCUE
## Experience
### Findings:
- __Last iteration__:
  - __Brainstorming__ generated more ideas than __analogical reasoning__.
  - __Combining ideas__ was most effective when done during storyboard development
  - __Removing constraints__ provided more ideas than presenting knowledge from the solution-space.
  - Reassured to run workshops after a first scope was defined
  - They did not find issues with runninng __one-day workshops__ instead of two

# Star Search
## Background
- Focus on short-term financial security makes is harder to see beyond today's needs and distinguish between ongoing and soon-to-be initiated projects
- This leads to incoming requirements concentrate around current projects
- However, it is necessary to look forward (especially in software companies) to achieve long-term success

# Star Search
## Idea
- Companies use their employees' capability for innovation because the development organization must have a deeper domain-understanding than a customer that usually uses a company's products in a single domain. (Robot Example)
- Making innovation a part of day-to-day business

# Star Search
## Requirements for such a System
- Proper decision making processes and justification materials that help balancing long term innovation with indispensable short term development efforts
- Focus on long-term Requirements
- Inputs from entire organization (devs, sales, etc.)
- Cost effective
- Produces quality material that managements can base their decisions on

# Star Search
## Process (4 Steps)
1. Call for Innovation
2. Audition (Value Case)
3. Preparation (Business Case)
4. Decision (Business Case)

# Star Search
## Step 1: Call for Innovation
- Made by Audition Group (AG) chair
- Can be directed towards a certain product line or process
- Make form and information available to all people
- People/Groups with ideas sign up

# Star Search
## Step 2: Audition
- Informal setting with AG
- Flexible presentation/discussion style
- Important to give feedback to contender
- If case is dismissed, give reasons and publish case with reasoning
- Create Value Case (light version of a business case)

# Star Search
## Step 3: Case Preparation and Screening
- AG passes value cases from auditions to the Case Preparation Group (CPG)
- CPG focuses on further refining the case into a in-depth business case
- Contender my be consulted
- Consult with experts to assess feasibility and long-term impact
- Should a case be dismissed at this stage, the same "rules" apply as in the Audition Step

# Star Search
## Step 4: Case Decision
- CPG passes business cases to the company's Case Decision Group (CDG)
- CDG already exists in all software development companies
- Bring Star Search cases into requirements selection and priorization in addition to regular business cases

# Star Search
## Results and Conclusions
- Authors ran Star Search for 1 year at different organizations
- Generally positive results
- Face-to-face meetings are favored by employees, compared to static/passive techniques of innovation
- Fast feedback and immediate discussion of ideas considered more important than thorough evaluation

### Company 1
- 25% increase in innovation candidates on roadmap
- 25% of of items in development-pipeline are from Star Search cases

### Company 2
- 1 innovation candidate per 10 employees
- 5% of all innovation candidates make it to market


# Comparison/Conclusion of the two
