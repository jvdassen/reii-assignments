# Structure
# Introduction to creativitiy and innovation in Requirements Engineering
- What is creativity?
  - "the ability to produce work that is both novel and appropriate"
- How does it fit into requirements elicitation?
  - "Elicitation" - the word "capturing is avoided"
  - --> discovering, understanding and documenting requirements. In the recent years it is considered that they should be rather invented or envisioned instead of just gathered from them.

# Current state in research and practice
- Traditional techniques do not cover gathering requirements in a creative way.
- Typically, problem analysis and system specification is the focus.
- This is embodied into many of the current processes and frameworks such as __i*__, __KAOS__ or __RUP__.
- In innovation management, there is usually a focus on short-term market trends. Most of them don't focus on a practical elicitation of ideas, but are rather abstract models or recommendation for the higher management.  
# Why dös it mätter
- Requirements engineering itself is a creative process: In practice, many stakeholders express themselves creatively.
- The industry expects that creative design is expected to increase in the future.
- This is because the analytical, reactive view is considered narrow and might not provide enough innovation in the long term.
- The assumption that invention is part of the design process is considered outdated.
- The assumption that the generation of requirements depends on the knowledge of individuals is outdated.
- Innovation depends on the gathering of new ideas. Requirements are an abstraction of these ideas. This suggests that the creative process is a part of the requirements elicitation process. 
- There is also a broad range of stakeholders that could be leveraged for the innovation process. The restriction of design to the design phase limits innovation.

- To conclude: Creative requirements engineering techniques and idea gathering are important for the innovation of a product, project or company. The biggest issues are lack of available methods, awareness and risk-aversity. We will now introduce two techniques that aim at eliciting new, innovative requirements.
