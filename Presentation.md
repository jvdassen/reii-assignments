# Structure
# Introduction to creativitiy and innovation in Requirements Engineering
# Current state in research and practice
- Traditional techniques do not cover gathering requirements in a creative way.
- Typically, problem analysis and system specification is the focus.
- This is embodied into many of the current processes and frameworks such as __i*__, __KAOS__ or __RUP__.
# Why dös it mätter
- Requirements engineering itself is a creative process: In practice, many stakeholders express themselves creatively.
- The industry expects that creative design is expected to increase in the future.
- This is because the analytical, reactive view is considered narrow and might not provide enough innovation in the long term.
- The assumption that invention is part of the design process is considered outdated.
- The assumption that the generation of requirements depends on the knowledge of individuals is outdated.
- Innovation depends on the gathering of new ideas. Requirements are an abstraction of these ideas. This suggests that the creative process is a part of the requirements elicitation process. 
- There is also a broad range of stakeholders that could be leveraged for the innovation process. The restriction of design to the design phase limits innovation.

- To conclude: Creative requirements engineering techniques and idea gathering are important for the innovation of a product, project or company. We will now introduce two techniques that aim at enabling just that.
